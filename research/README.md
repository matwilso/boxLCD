**ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK**

These are active experiments and hacking I am doing. 

This is basically my personal messy code for training models on boxLCD.

It is probably not good etiquette to keep it in the same repo as the boxLCD envs and stuff.
But it is a bit more convenient, and until it seems like anyone else but me cares about this project,
I'll probably just keep this connected since it makes my life slightly easier.
